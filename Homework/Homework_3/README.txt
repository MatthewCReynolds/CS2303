    Matthew Reynolds. I didn't have any help outside of the provided code from the original file.

Purpose:
    calculate sales and associated figures from provided files

How it works:
    opens each file and then saves it into the two arrays, the 50x6 and the 50x2. then calls each function to calculate
    figures and have them print into their newly made .txt files. each function calculates the sums from the months, and
    then the associated figures and prints them to their new .txt files

How to run & cleanup:
    use the makefile commands
