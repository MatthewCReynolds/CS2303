    Matthew Reynolds. I didn't have any help outside of the provided code from the original file.

Purpose:
    calculate sales and associated figures from provided files

How it works:
    the files provided from the command line are opened and read from. then stored in a 50x6 array for dispatch to the functions.
    the functions create/write over files and print the things they compute into them. Whether thats the top 10, profits,
    or total sales.

How to run & cleanup:
    use the makefile commands
